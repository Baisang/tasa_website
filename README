# TASA Website

This is the source code for the Taiwanese American Student Association at UC Berkeley. It is currently hosted by the Open Computing Facility.

## Conventions

1. Don't do `git add .` or `git add -u`, just do `git add -u` to only add changes for tracked files
2. Don't track files that contain sensitive information such as OAuth keys, API keys, or passwords
3. Keep things as simple as possible, no need to have too many fancy features
4. Try not to edit on the live servers, because that is bad

## Developer Setup
Here is how to set up a local version of the website on your own machine.

1. Clone the repository using git
2. Install and activate virtualenv
3. Use pip to install all of the modules in requirements.txt
4. `python tasa_website.py` should start running the server locally
