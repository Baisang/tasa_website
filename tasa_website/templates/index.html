              <h2>Our History</h2>
              <p class="text-justify">
                TASA was initially founded in 2003 to provide a way for Taiwanese-American students to connect with and understand their Taiwanese heritage and identity. Since then, TASA has grown to accomodate all students on campus interested in Taiwanese and Taiwanese-American culture. We've grown and changed much over the years, but our mission to promote community, awareness, and friendship amongst the student body has remained the same. We love hosting fun events for all of our members and look forward to making TASA history this semester!</p>

                <h2>Families</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">
                  One of TASA's biggest draws is the family system! Families provide an opportunity to get to know other members on a more intimate and personal level in smaller and more frequent get-togethers. Some fun family events we've had in the past include picnics, water balloon fights, making dumplings, or just getting a bite to eat with your family! There's no rules about sticking only to one family, so feel free to attend all of our family events! We hope to foster some lifelong friendships through our family system.</p>

              <p class="text-justify">
                TASA holds events on a near-weekly basis to bring together and build a community for Taiwanese-Americans and those interested in Taiwanese culture at Berkeley. We host a wide range of events, from making traditional Taiwanese foods and playing mahjong to exploring the streets of San Francisco, with the purpose of fostering close friendships and a greater appreciation for Taiwanese culture. TASA also holds events in collaboration with other cultural groups on campus, including the Taiwanese Student Association, the Korean American Student Association, and International Students Association at Berkeley. Check out some of our past events, and be sure to join us at our next one!</p>

                  We wouldn't be able to do anything at TASA without our lovely cabinet. Officers plan and organize all of the events for our members and work hard to make sure that everyone has a good time. We're a diverse group hailing from all sorts of foreign countries and random states you've never heard about! We're proud to call TASA home and we are more than happy to welcome you to our TASA family. And, for those interested in getting involved, we have an officer internship program just for you.<br><br><br><br></p>
